**BACKGROUND**
--------

- To this point all of our planetary simulations have involve two-body solar systems. It is now time to consider some of the things that can happen when there are three or more objects in the solar system. The problem of two objects interacting through the inverse=square law can be solved exactly ( as we have already mentioned ), leading to Kepler's laws. However, if we add just one more planet to give what is known as the **three-body problem**, an analytic theory becomes much more difficult. In fact, there are very few exact results in this case, even though it has been studied extensively for several centuries. Indeed, the three-body, or more generally the **n-body problem**, is the problem of celestial mechanics.                  

  
**METHOD**
----

We have used the Euler-Cromer method. That is, we use the previous values of position and velocity to update the velocities, while the previous values of position and the new values of velocity are used to update the positions. As we discussed, the Euler method is not a good choice for oscillatory problems, and planetary motion is just such a problem. If we were to use the Euler method here we would find that the energy od the planet would grow with time, and it would spiral away from the Sun. This difficulty is avioded with the Euler-Cromer method, since it conserves energy exactly over the course of each orbit.:

**MODEL**
----
- We consider one of the simplest three-body problems, the Sun and two planets, which we will take to be Earth and Jupiter. We know that without Jupiter, Earth's orbit is stable and unchanging with time. Our objective is to observe how much effect the gravitational force from Jupiter has on Earth's motion. We consider Jupiter since, at about 0.1% of the solar mass, it is by far the largest planet in the solat system.      
- Writing **F_E,J** in terms of components yields

for the **x** component of the force, with a corresponding result for the **y** component. Here **x_e** and **x_j** are the coordinates of Earth and Jupiter ( the Sun remains at the origin ), and **theta_E,J** is the angle defined. The total force on Earth in the **x** dirction will be the sum of the forces of gravity from the Sun and Jupiter, yielding the equation of motion for the **x** component of Earth's velocity, **v_x,e**

where **r** is again the distance from Earth to the Sun. We can convert this and the corresponding result for **v_y,e**, into difference equations. Since **M_S** is much greater than **M_J** or **M_E**, we may treat the Sun to be stationary at the origin and just calculate the positions of Jupiter and Earth. Thus, the only thing left to do is calculate **GM_J** in the appropriate units, Here it is simplest to use the result

with **M_J** and **M_S** given. A program to calculate the orbits of two planets in this approximation is a straightforword extension of the one we sketched for the two-body solar system previously. We now need to update the positions and velocities of both planets at each step through the main loop. A sketch of such a calculation is given.

- **First**, assume one of the two bodies is the center of the motion system. According to that, useing the reduced mass is a necessary option to simplify the probelm like：
